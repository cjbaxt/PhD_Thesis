\chapter{Contribution from co-authors}

The position in the author list reflects the importance of the contribution of each co-author. I have omitted Jean-Michel D\'{e}sert from each chapter, as his supervision was present throughout the thesis.

  \note{CB developed the data reduction pipeline based on previous studies for the reduction of 3.6 and 4.5\um~ Spitzer/IRAC data. Data used in the paper was taken from the Spitzer heritage archive, based on proposals by Jean-Michel D\'esert and Drake Deming. Shang-Min Tsai created the grids of forward models and contributed text to the section describing the models. Daniel Thorngren provided a table of radius anomalies. CB performed all data analysis, comparisons between data and models and wrote the manuscript. All of the co-authors provided feedback to the complete manuscript.}

  \cojournal{Astronomy \& Astrophysics, 639, A36 (2020)}
  \note{CB augmented the data reduction pipeline for reduction of Spitzer/IRAC eclipses. CB performed the search of the literature and collected all of the eclipse data. Mike Line provided the grid of forward models and contributed text to the section describing the models. Megan Mansfield provided the HST/WFC3 spectra. CB performed all data analysis on the secondary eclipses and the emission models. All of the co-authors provided feedback to the complete manuscript.}

  \cojournal{To be submitted to Astronomy \& Astrophysics}
  \note{CB performed the data reduction and analysis of the archival eclipses and wrote the full manuscript. All co-authors provided feedback to the manuscript.}

  \coitem{TTVs} %
  \coauthors{Claire Baxter,
            Jean-Michel D\'esert,
            Daniel Fabrycky}
  \cojournal{To be submitted to Astronomy \& Astrophysics}
  \note{CB performed the data reduction of the Spitzer transits. Daniel Fabrycky provided the transit times of the Kepler data, fit TTV models to the Kepler data and provided propagated predictions for the transit times of the multi-planet systems. Daniel Fabrycky also performed photodynamical modelling of the Kepler-16 data from Kepler and provided the relevant text for all of his contributions. CB performed the analysis of the reduced Spitzer transits and made comparisons with TTV predictions. CB wrote the manuscript, with the exceptions of the TTV modelling sections. All co-authors provided feedback to the draft manuscript.}
